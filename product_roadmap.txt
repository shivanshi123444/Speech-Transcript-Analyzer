Subject: Product Sigma - Q3 Roadmap Sync

Maria: Good morning team, let's dive into our Q3 roadmap for Product Sigma. Our main goal for this quarter is to launch the new "Collaborative Editing" feature and improve existing user onboarding. We need to finalize the MVP scope for collaborative editing by end of next week.

Tom: On the development side, I've allocated resources for the collaborative editing feature. We estimate two sprints for the core functionality. Blockers: We're still awaiting final API documentation from the backend team for real-time syncing. This is critical for starting sprint 1.
Action Item: Tom to follow up with Backend Team for API documentation by July 5th.

Lena: From a UX perspective, I've completed the initial wireframes for collaborative editing and begun user testing for the onboarding flow. Insight: Early user feedback strongly indicates a need for a more visually guided onboarding tutorial, not just text. Users are getting stuck on step 3.

Chris: QA is preparing a test matrix for the collaborative editing feature. We'll need access to the development environment as soon as the basic integration is complete, hopefully by mid-July.
Action Item: Chris to finalize QA test matrix by July 10th.

Maria: Great insights, Lena. We must prioritize that onboarding tutorial. Key Decision: Allocate an additional week in Sprint 1 for developing the interactive onboarding tutorial based on Lena's findings. Tom, please factor this into dev estimates.
Tom: Understood.

Maria: We also need to define success metrics for the collaborative editing feature. How will we measure its impact post-launch?
Insight: Clear, measurable success metrics (e.g., daily active users of feature, collaborative session duration) are crucial for evaluating new feature adoption.
Action Item: Maria to draft success metrics for Collaborative Editing feature by July 12th.

Chris: One more thing. We've seen a slight increase in bug reports related to file upload stability on the current version. It's not critical, but worth monitoring.
Insight: File upload stability needs monitoring as a potential area of concern.

Maria: Thank you, Chris. Let's keep an eye on that. Overall, good progress. Tom, your API docs are the immediate blocker. Let's ensure that's resolved.
