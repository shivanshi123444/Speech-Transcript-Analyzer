Facilitator: Alright team, let's brainstorm ideas for our new product launch campaign. No bad ideas, just throw them out there!
Participant A: What if we do a viral video challenge? Something that encourages user-generated content.
Participant B: I like the viral idea. We could tie it to a charitable cause, makes it more impactful.
Participant C: My initial thought was more traditional, like a series of sponsored articles. But a challenge could generate more buzz.
Participant A: We definitely need a strong hashtag. Something catchy and memorable.
Facilitator: Good point. A strong, unique hashtag is essential. That's a key takeaway.
Participant B: And we need to consider the target audience's preferred platforms. Is it TikTok, Instagram, or something else?
Participant C: Maybe a teaser campaign leading up to the main launch? Build anticipation.
Facilitator: Teaser campaign, interesting. And audience platforms â€“ yes, that's a critical decision point for our media plan. We need a definitive decision on primary platforms by next Friday.
Participant A: I can research current platform engagement trends in our demographic.
Facilitator: Action: Participant A to research platform trends by July 4, 2025.
